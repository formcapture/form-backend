An Express backend for serving dynamic forms based on custom configurations via a webapp, integrating with PostgREST for data access.

## Demo Application

A simple demo application with some sample forms can be found in `./demo`.
Take a look at `./demo/README.md` for details on how to get the demo
up and running.

## Docs

User docs are available on a running instance on `/docs`.

## App

A React webapp to to render dataview tables and forms. While the table view shows all records in a filterable overview table, the detail view renders the actual form to edit a record. Several specific Postmessage API events supports the integration of the webapp in other clients (e.g. to visualize spatial data). See [app/README.md](respective README) for more information.

## Backend
The backend that will serve the webapp as well as handle requests. [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org) is required to access data and [keycloak](https://keycloak.org) for authentification. Please check the `demo` folder to run a test setup.
